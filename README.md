Microsoft Excel NYC Transit Bus Breakdown/Delay Analysis
# NYC Transit Bus Breakdown & Delay Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes NYC school transit bus breakdown and delay data to identify operational trends, recurring failure points, and time-based patterns that impact transportation reliability. Using Microsoft Excel as the primary analysis tool, raw transit records were transformed into structured datasets and summarized into actionable insights suitable for operational and administrative decision-making.

The focus of this project was to demonstrate strong data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and reporting skills using Excel in a real-world public-sector dataset.

## Objectives

* Clean and standardize raw NYC transit breakdown and delay records
* Identify common causes of bus delays and breakdowns
* Analyze trends by day of week and delay duration
* Evaluate whether specific days correlate with increased service disruptions
* Produce clear summary outputs and visualizations for stakeholder review

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains NYC school transit bus breakdown and delay records, including:

* School year
* Bus and route identifiers
* Run type (e.g., Special Education, Pre-K)
* Delay or breakdown reason
* Date and time of occurrence
* Day of week
* Estimated delay duration
* Number of students impacted

Raw data required significant preprocessing before analysis.

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key data preparation steps included:

* Standardizing date and time formats
* Extracting and validating day-of-week fields
* Normalizing categorical values (run type, delay reason, route)
* Handling missing, null, and inconsistent values
* Removing unused or extraneous columns
* Creating cleaned, analysis-ready datasets

A dedicated **Cleaned Data** worksheet was created to serve as the foundation for all downstream analysis.

---

## Analysis Performed

The following analytical techniques were applied:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand distribution and frequency of delays
* **PivotTables** to aggregate breakdown counts and delay durations
* **Day-of-week analysis** to identify temporal patterns
* **Root-cause analysis** to surface the most common delay reasons
* **Delay duration grouping** to assess severity and operational impact

Multiple PivotTables and supporting worksheets were created to isolate trends across different dimensions of the data.

---

## Key Insights

* Identified recurring delay and breakdown causes, including mechanical failures and traffic-related issues
* Observed variations in breakdown frequency across different days of the week
* Highlighted time periods and service types with higher disruption rates

*(Specific metrics and percentages can be added if desired.)*

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Work with real-world, imperfect data
* Apply structured analytical thinking using Excel
* Translate raw data into insights that support operational decision-making
* Communicate findings clearly through organized outputs and visuals

---

## Future Enhancements

* Rebuild the analysis pipeline using SQL or Python
* Add automated dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
* Perform deeper statistical analysis on delay correlations
* Incorporate additional years of transit data
